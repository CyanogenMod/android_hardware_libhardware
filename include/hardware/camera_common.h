/**
 * Module versioning information for the Camera hardware module, based on
 * camera_module_t.common.module_api_version. The two most significant hex
 * digits represent the major version, and the two least significant represent
 * the minor version.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * Versions: 0.X - 1.X [CAMERA_MODULE_API_VERSION_1_0]
 *
 *   Camera modules that report these version numbers implement the initial
 *   camera module HAL interface. All camera devices openable through this
 *   module support only version 1 of the camera device HAL. The device_version
 *   and static_camera_characteristics fields of camera_info are not valid. Only
 *   the android.hardware.Camera API can be supported by this module and its
 *   devices.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * Version: 2.0 [CAMERA_MODULE_API_VERSION_2_0]
 *
 *   Camera modules that report this version number implement the second version
 *   of the camera module HAL interface. Camera devices openable through this
 *   module may support either version 1.0 or version 2.0 of the camera device
 *   HAL interface. The device_version field of camera_info is always valid; the
 *   static_camera_characteristics field of camera_info is valid if the
 *   device_version field is 2.0 or higher.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * Version: 2.1 [CAMERA_MODULE_API_VERSION_2_1]
 *
 *   This camera module version adds support for asynchronous callbacks to the
 *   framework from the camera HAL module, which is used to notify the framework
 *   about changes to the camera module state. Modules that provide a valid
 *   set_callbacks() method must report at least this version number.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * Version: 2.2 [CAMERA_MODULE_API_VERSION_2_2]
 *
 *   This camera module version adds vendor tag support from the module, and
 *   deprecates the old vendor_tag_query_ops that were previously only
 *   accessible with a device open.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * Version: 2.3 [CAMERA_MODULE_API_VERSION_2_3]
 *
 *   This camera module version adds open legacy camera HAL device support.
 *   Framework can use it to open the camera device as lower device HAL version
 *   HAL device if the same device can support multiple device API versions.
 *   The standard hardware module open call (common.methods->open) continues
 *   to open the camera device with the latest supported version, which is
 *   also the version listed in camera_info_t.device_version.
